            <p>In the summer of 2019, I joined a team of volunteers to organize a video game event that raised over
                <i>$60,000</i> for <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/">Extra Life</a>, a program of Children's Miracle Network
                Hospitals that funds critical life-saving treatments and healthcare services for children! I created two in-game
                missions and mainly handled QA testing and feedback for user-submitted content.</p>

            <h3>Full-Stack Encrypted Chat App</h3>
            <p>In November of 2023, I challenged myself by creating a full-stack chat app to learn about modern tools
                and frameworks in front-end development, as well as web communication. Using Next.js and Redis, I made
                an app that allowed for Google sign ins and real-time chatting, secured end-to-end using SHA-512. You
                could also add and remove friends! The project isn't pretty, but it worked, was fun, and was a strong
                learning experience.</p>
